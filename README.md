> **Note:** this test assignment was completed in March 2023. It is a simple solution that reflects my experience with WebdriverIO at that time. The project is based on an open-source WebdriverIO v8 + Cucumber boilerplate (see LICENSE).

### WebdriverIO-v8 boilerplate code with Cucumber BDD



### Installation


`Node.JS:` Install  from the site - https://nodejs.org/en/  take the LTS version based on your Operating system. Please make sure you install NodeJS globally. To take full advantage of the command line you will need to make sure that you have added `node_modules/.bin` to your `$PATH`.  Otherwise you will need to install `npm install -g` globally.


`JDK:` It is optional, install JDK and make sure class path is set properly. JAVA is require to start `Selenium Server` on your local environment nothing else.

### Run Some Sample Tests

To execute the entire test suite on local development or cloud provider, you can use below

Option 1: Local Environment `npm run test-local`.



### Logs  

Complete set of execution `logs` will be generated during the run time and can be found in the parent folder location /logs.


##### Allure

The Allure Reporter creates [Allure](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/) test reports which is an HTML generated website with all necessary information to debug your test results and take a look on error screenshots. Add allure to the reporters array in config file and define the output directory of the allure reports.  Please note, this has been added in wdio.shared.config.

To generate and view an Allure report inside your corp network or locally, run `npm run allure-report`. The Allure report is hosted on a `web server` and can be accessed through http://YourMachineIP:5050/ and also generated locally which can be found at `./allure-report/index.html`. A typical Allure report will look like this.

##### Spec

Test reporter, that prints detailed results to console.

### Develop automation scripts (for both desktop browser and mobile browser / app)

You can write test by using Cucumber BDD framework. You can choose javascript based design pattern or ES6 based.

Refer complete [WebdriverIO v8 API](https://webdriver.io/docs/api) methods to write your automation tests.

##### Using Cucumber JavaScript framework

Tests are written in the Cucumber framework using the Gherkin Syntax. More about Gherkin & Cucumber can be found at https://cucumber.io/

Tests are place in `*.feature` files in the `/test/features/` directory. A typical test will look similar to this:
```
Feature: The Internet Guinea Pig Website

  Scenario Outline: As a user, I can log into the secure area

    Given I am on the login page
    When I login with <username> and <password>
    Then I should see a flash message saying <message>

    Examples:
      | username | password             | message                        |
      | tomsmith | SuperSecretPassword! | You logged into a secure area! |
      | foobar   | barfoo               | Your username is invalid!      |

```
### The Page Object Design Pattern

Within your web app's UI there are areas that your tests interact with. A Page Object simply models these as objects within the test code. This reduces the amount of duplicated code and means that if the UI changes, the fix need only be applied in one place. In other wards one of the challenges of writing test automation is keeping your [selectors] (classes, id's, or xpath' etc.) up to date with the latest version of your code.  The next challenge is to keep the code you write nice and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).  The page object pattern helps us accomplish this in one solution.  Instead of including our selectors in our step definitions in cucumber, we instead place them in a `<pagename>.ts` file where we can manage all these selectors and methods together. Your test file should only call the test methods.

You can also place reusable functions or logic inside of these pages and call them from your step files. The page object serves as a layer of abstraction between tests and code.  When a test fails, it fails on a individual step.  That step may call a selector that is no longer valid, but that selector may be used by many other steps.  By having a single source of truth of what the selector is supposed to be, fixing one selector on the page object could repair a number of failing tests that were affected by the same selector.

An object called `Page` will be created with the prototype model or by ES6 class pattern.  This ensures that every instance of a page object is exported as a stateless construct. Any any changes to that state are handled in the browser, rather than on the server.

It is preferable to separate page objects into individual files that end with `.page.ts`.  These will require the basic `page.ts` prototype construct / abstract class and create new objects for each individual page.

For more information on the implementation of `Page Object Design Pattern`, refer to the `/test/pageobjects` directory. A typical page class using ES6 syntax will look similar to this:

💡 If you want to use ES5 syntax, refer to the sample.page.js under util-examples.

```
//pageobject using async mode//

class LoginPage extends Page {
    /**
     * define selectors using getter methods
     */
    public get inputUsername () {
        return $('#username');
    }

    public get inputPassword () {
        return $('#password');
    }

    public get btnSubmit () {
        return $('button[type="submit"]');
    }

    /**
     * a method to encapsule automation code to interact with the page
     * e.g. to login using username and password
     */
    public async login (username: string, password: string) {
        await this.inputUsername.setValue(username);
        await this.inputPassword.setValue(password);
        await this.btnSubmit.click();
    }

    /**
     * overwrite specific options to adapt it to page object
     */
    public open () {
        return super.open('login');
    }
}
export default new LoginPage();

```

### Additional Utilities (out of scope of this framework)

#### Working with DataBase

A relational database is, simply, a database that stores related information across multiple tables and allows you to query information in more than one table at the same time. Your application under test displays data from these database. So when you are actually performing automation testing it is very likely that you need to verify the data between actual (which you got it from browser) Vs expected (which you will get it from the database by executing SQL statements on database). This can be done by below statements in your code.
```
//example of connection to Oracle DataBase

var  db   = require('node-any-jdbc');

cogfig = {
  libpath: './config/drivers/oracle/ojdbc7.jar',
  drivername: 'oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver',
  url:  'jdbc:oracle:thin:QA/password123@//abc-test.corp.int:1527/stage1',
  // uri: 'jdbc:oracle:thin://abc-test.corp.int:1527/stage1',
  // user: 'QA',
  // password: 'password123',
};

//example of sample select query to fetch the result set

var sql = 'SELECT * FROM emp_info where emp_id = "1001"';
db.execute(cogfig, sql, function(results){
  //console.log(results);
  //then do what ever validation you want to do with results
});

```
For trouble shooting and more information, please visit `node-any-jdbc` module which can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-any-jdbc)

Note: `node-any-jdbc` is NOT packaged under this project. If you need, you can install it as a separate npm module `npm install node-any-jdbc --save` and start using it right away.
You can also find sample examples under /util-examples/database-example.js

### Working with Excel File

You can use `MS-Excel / OpenOffice` Excel files and store your test data, expected data in an excel sheet. you can keep any number of excel sheets you want and use below common methods to pull data from your sheet to be use as part of testing.  Please note it only support `.xlsx` file format. For more information refer to the `common-utilities.js` and `util-examples`

```
//example of pulling data from MS-Excel

var  utl  = require('../utilities/common-utilities.js');
utl.excel_getTableRow(__dirname+'/sample.xlsx', 'info', 'emp_id', '101', function(results){
  // returns only one row based on the condition
  //console.log(results);
  //console.log(results.emp_id);
});

utl.excel_getTableRows(__dirname+'/sample.xlsx', 'address', function(results){
  // returns all rows of the specified sheet
  //console.log(results[1]);
  //then do what ever validation you to do withe results
});

utl.excel_getAllSheetData(__dirname+'/sample.xlsx', function(results){
  // returns all sheets data of a excel file
  //console.log(results);
  //then do what ever validation you to do withe results
});

```

### Common utilities

Refer to the common Javascript functions that provides clean, performant methods for manipulating objects, collections, MS-Excel utilities, DataBase utilities etc. Few sample code can be found in /util-examples/

Use [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) already bundled inside the framework which provides over 100 functions that support both your favorite workaday functional helpers: map, filter, invoke — as well as more specialized goodies: function binding, javascript templating, creating quick indexes, deep equality testing, and so on.

### History

Industry is moving towards Node.js / JavaScript, Angularjs, Full-Stack world. WebdriverIO, a JavaScript binding wrapper for Selenium Webdriver, was originated by Camilo Tapia's initial Selenium project called WebdriverJS, which was the first Webdriver project on NPM. In 2014, the project was renamed WebdriverIO later on. This repository is a pre-configured version of webdriverIO meant to jump-start the process of writing new test automation or adding test automation to existing node.js applications.
